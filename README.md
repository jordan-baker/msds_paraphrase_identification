# msds_paraphrase_identification]

The purpose of this project is to identify whether two questions are semantically linked, in other words, determine if they are "paraphrases" of eachother or not. We employ a variety of methods, some our own and some from other successful iterations of the same taks. The primary method we use is from Ji and Einstein (2013) and their "state of the art" TF-KLD weighting method: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/papers/ji-emnlp-2013.pdf
Additionally we build out a technique to classify instances using a similarity based metric compared with a supervised ML method..
